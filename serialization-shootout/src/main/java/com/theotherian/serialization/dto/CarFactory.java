    "Groening and Cohen wanted Futurama to be shown at 8:30pm on Sunday, following The Simpsons. The Fox network disagreed, opting instead to show two episodes in the Sunday night lineup before moving the show to a regular time slot on Tuesday.[33] Beginning with its second broadcast season Futurama was again placed in the 8:30 Sunday spot,[34] but by mid-season the show was moved again, this time to 7:00pm on Sunday, its third position in under a year.[35] Even by the fourth season Futurama was still being aired erratically.[36] Due to being regularly pre-empted by sporting events, it became difficult to predict when new episodes would air. This erratic schedule resulted in Fox not airing several episodes that had been produced for seasons three and four, instead holding them over for a fifth broadcast season. According to Groening, Fox executives were not supporters of the show.[37] Although Futurama was never officially canceled, midway through the production of the fourth season, Fox decided to stop buying episodes of Futurama, letting it go out of production before the fall 2003 lineup.[38][39] In 2005, Comedy Central acquired the syndication rights to Futurama.[40] During the negotiations, Comedy Central discussed the possibility of producing new episodes. In 2006, it was announced that four straight-to-DVD films would be produced, and later split into 16 episodes comprising a fifth season of the show.[41] Since no new Futurama projects were in production at the time of release, the final movie release Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film.[42] In an interview with CNN, Groening said that we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me.[43] In June 2009, 20th Century Fox announced that Comedy Central had picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes that began airing on June 24, 2010.[44][45][46] The returning writing crew was smaller than the original crew.[47] It was originally announced that main voice actors West, DiMaggio, and Sagal would return as well, but on July 17, 2009, it was announced that a casting notice was posted to replace the entire cast when 20th Century Fox Television would not meet their salary demands.[48] The situation was later resolved, and the entire original voice-cast returned for the new episodes. The dispute had stopped the original actors from appearing on the Futurama panel for Comic-Con 2009, to the disappointment of fans.[49] Near the end of a message from Maurice LaMarche sent to members of the Save the Voices of Futurama group on Facebook, LaMarche announced that the original cast would be returning for the new episodes.[50] The Toronto Star confirmed, announcing on their website that the original cast of Futurama signed contracts with Fox to return for 26 more episodes.[51] Similarly, an email sent to fans from Cohen and Groening reported that West, Sagal, DiMaggio, LaMarche, MacNeille, Tom, LaMarr, and Herman would all be returning for the revival.[52] Cohen told Newsday in August 2009 that the reported 26-episode order means [i]t will be up to 26. I can't guarantee it will be 26. But I think there's a pretty good chance it'll be exactly 26. Fox has been a little bit cagey about it, even internally. But nobody's too concerned. We're plunging ahead.[53] Two episodes were in the process of being voice-recorded at that time, with an additional six scripts ... in the works, ranging in scale from 'it's a crazy idea that someone's grandmother thought of' to 'it's all on paper'.[53] When Futurama aired June 24, 2010, on Comedy Central, it helped the network to its highest-rated night in 2010 and its highest-rated Thursday primetime in the network's history.[54] In March 2011, it was announced that Futurama has been renewed for a seventh season, consisting of at least 26 episodes, scheduled to air in 2012 and 2013.[5][6] The first episode of season 7 premiered June 20, 2012, on Comedy Central.[55] In July 2011, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication by both local affiliates and WGN America. Broadcast of old episodes began in September 2011.[56] On September 19, 2011, WGN America began re-running Futurama, and now airs the series weeknights during the overnight hours, and once on Saturday nights.[57] Futurama has since doubled its viewership in syndication.[58] Due to the uncertain future of the series, there have been four designated series finales. The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings, Into the Wild Green Yonder and Overclockwise have all been written to serve as a final episode for the show.[59][60] The episode Meanwhile currently stands as the show's official series finale.

    "Jeremy Clarkson, who helped the original series reach its peak in the 1990s, along with producer Andy Wilman, successfully pitched a new format for Top Gear to the BBC, reversing a previous decision to cancel the show in 2001. The new series was first broadcast in 2002. Instead of a stage or studio, such asBBC Television Centre in London, Top Gear's studio is located at the Dunsfold Aerodrome, an airport and business park in Waverley, Surrey. Top Gear uses a temporary racing circuit which was designed for the show by Lotus and is laid out on parts of Dunsfold's runways and taxiways. A large aircraft hangar is used for studio recording with a standing audience. The new series format incorporates a number of major changes from the old show. The running time was extended to one hour and two new presenters were introduced: Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe, with James May replacing Dawe after the first series. The Stig, an anonymous, helmeted racing driver, was introduced as the test driver. New segments were also added, including Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, The Cool Wall, The News, Power Laps, and one-off features such as races, competitions, the regular destruction of caravans, and, more recently, Morris Marinas, which cannot appear on the show without being destroyed (most commonly by a piano landing on the roof). In early 2006, the BBC had a plan to move the film site from Dunsfold to Enstone, Oxfordshire for filming of the eighth series of Top Gear, but the move was rejected by West Oxfordshire council due to noise and pollution concerns.[8] Filming of the series went ahead at Dunsfold in May despite not having a permit to do so,[9] with a revamped studio set, a new car for the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment, and the inclusion of one of Hammond's dogs, named Top Gear Dog (now known as TeeGee), in a few studio and film segments of that series. On 20 September 2006, Richard Hammond was seriously injured while driving a Vampire turbojet drag racing car at up to 314 miles per hour (505km/h) for a feature in the show. The BBC indefinitely postponed the broadcast of Best of Top Gear and announced that production of the show would be delayed until Hammond had recovered. Both the BBC and the Health and Safety Executive carried out inquiries into the accident.[10] Filming resumed on 5 October 2006.[11] The ninth series began on 28 January 2007 and included footage of Hammond's crash.[12] The first show of the ninth series attracted higher ratings than the finale of Celebrity Big Brother[13] and the final episode of the series had 8 million viewers BBC Two's highest ratings for a decade.   1.  Top: Series 1 host lineup from left to right: Jason Dawe, Richard Hammond, andJeremy Clarkson. 2.  Bottom: The presenters from Series 2 onward: James May, Richard Hammond, and Jeremy Clarkson. A special programme, Top Gear: Polar Special, was broadcast in the UK on 25 July 2007 and was the first episode to be shown in high-definition. It involved a race to the North Magnetic Pole[14] from Resolute, Nunavut, Canada, with James May and Jeremy Clarkson travelling in a 'polar modified' Toyota Hilux, and Richard Hammond on an Alexander Tachauer drawn sled. All three presenters had experienced explorers with them, and Clarkson and May became the first to reach the 1996 North Magnetic Pole by car, using the vehicle's satellite navigation. Since 1996, the North Magnetic Pole had moved approximately 100 miles (160km). The recorded 1996 location is the target used by Polar Challenge and was used by the Top Gear team as their destination; the Geographic North Poleis approximately 800 miles (1,300km) further north. On 9 September 2007, Top Gear participated in the 2007 Britcar 24-hour race at Silverstone, where the hosts (including The Stig) drove a race-prepared, second-hand diesel BMW 330d and finished 3rd in class and 39th overall. The car was fuelled using biodiesel refined from crops shown during a tractor review in the previous series. By 2008, Top Gear had become so popular that the waiting list to get tickets for a recording included more than 300,000 names, or 21 years worth of episodes.[15] In 2008, the show was adapted into a live format called Top Gear Live. The tour started on 30 October 2008 in Earls Court, London, moving on to Birmingham in November then at least 15 other countries worldwide. Produced by former Top Gear producer Rowland French[16] the events were described as an attempt to bring the tv show format to life... featuring breath-taking stunts, amazing special effects and blockbusting driving sequences featuring some of the world's best precision drivers.[17] On 17 June 2008, in an interview on BBC Radio 1's The Chris Moyles Show, Hammond and May confirmed that in Series 11 there would be a new occasional regular host.[18] This was revealed to be Top Gear Stunt Man. The series' executive producer, Andy Wilman, also revealed that future ",
    "Production history[edit] The series was greenlit and given a 13-episode order by ABC on May 11, 2007.[5] On October 23, 2007, the show received a full season order.[6] However, scripts for nine episodes were completed before the start of the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike.[7] Bryan Fuller reportedly made last-minute changes to the ninth episode to allow it to serve as a season finale, adjusting the episode to be a cliffhanger.[8] Because of the Writers Guild strike, the show completed just nine episodes of a 22-episode season.[9] Instead of attempting to complete the first season, the writers planned to begin work on the second season with production resuming around March to June 2008. Although ABC picked Pushing Daisies up for the 200809 television season, when ratings quickly declined ABC opted not to order additional episodes beyond the second season's initial thirteen.[10][11] By November 20, 2008, creator Bryan Fuller had confirmed that Pushing Daisies had been cancelled by ABC and expressed the possibility of wrapping up lingering plotlines in a comic book or movie sequel.[12] On July 17, 2008, Pushing Daisies was nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (Lee Pace), Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (Kristin Chenoweth), and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series (Bryan Fuller). It won three; for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series (Barry Sonnenfeld), Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Jim Dooley), and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series. The last scheduled episode was broadcast in the United States on December 17, 2008, leaving three episodes unaired, although those episodes were screened at the 2009 Paley Fest.[13] ABC was negotiating at one time to forfeit broadcast rights to the shows and make the unaired episodes available exclusively online,[14] but announced on April 3, 2009 the final three episodes would be broadcast on ABC Saturdays at 10:00 pm beginning May 30.[15] According to Chenoweth, these episodes do not provide a narrative conclusion to the series.[16] The final three episodes aired on ABC on successive Saturdays at 10:00 pm from Saturday, May 30, 2009 to June 13, 2009, having aired elsewhere around the world. In India, the last episode aired on February 27, 2009 as a world premiere. In Germany, the television network ProSieben showed the last three episodes of Pushing Daisies on March 4, 2009 (Window Dressed to Kill) and March 11, 2009 (Water and Power, Kerplunk). The three remaining unaired episodes were broadcast in the UK as ITV announced it would be showing the complete season in its run on the channel.[17] The original concept of Pushing Daisies was rooted from Dead Like Me. The show's creator, Bryan Fuller, intended for Pushing Daisies to be a spinoff of Dead Like Me.[18] Visual design[edit] Production designer Michael Wylie told TV Guide that, My goal was a storybook come to life. I wanted everything to look almost like an illustration. He achieved this by concentrating on conflicting patterns in different colors, particularly reds and oranges, but per director Barry Sonnenfeld, virtually no blues.[19] Cinematographer Michael Weaver told Variety that he and the producers decided the visuals should feel somewhere between Amlie and a Tim Burton film  something big, bright and bigger than life.[20]   Screenshot from Bzzzzzzzzz! showcasing its visual stylethe use of colors, symmetry, and shapes. The distinctive storybook-esque style is continued within the overall design of the visual aspects. Circular background shapes, circular windows, and framing shots within circles was a theme seen consistently throughout the series. Symmetry is a common theme used in the visual style, and characters are often framed in windows, doors, or background props. A heavy use of patterns within a location was often used, where a similar pattern would be used in almost the entire locationthe wallpaper, window blinds, bedsheets, pillows, furniture, and even clothing, such as Olive's apartment. The series would often use top-down perspectives and over-head shots would showcase its overall visual style. Regardless of the fact that the show focuses on murder investigations, the morgue is painted in candy-cane stripes and many outfits worn by the characters are vibrantly colored, bright, and cheery (for example, Olive's work uniform is a lime-green pinstriped dress, and Emerson is often seen wearing shades of purple).[21] Only Ned consistently wears black. CGI is prominent in the series, with much use of blue screen technology[22] (the shop window, similar set pieces and outdoor scenery outside often cast a blue halo tinge) and 3D set-extensions (streets, grass and landscape, the pie shop faade). The use of matte painting backdrops are used to complete the look.[23] Automobiles are often mint-condition vintage vehicles, though ",
    "Devotion to family The show explores most of the main characters' connections to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family.[57] In the third season he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, even if he is unloved.[58] In the final episode of the series, however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the 9.72 million dollars (which is all that he had managed to salvage) to her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, he refers to Jesse as his nephew, and laments the fact that he can't get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?[59] Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposely did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airline crash at the end of the second season. Even the show's more hardened characters maintain ties to family. In the second season, Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further explained in a flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that La familia es todo (Family is everything). Gustavo Fring's franchise Los Pollos Hermanostranslates to The Chicken Brothers. This refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family.[57] In the first part of the fifth season, it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his grand-daughter's future and by his last episode we see him conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he's warned the police are onto him. While on the second part of the season, white supremacist Jack Welker says don't skimp on family, and lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. Pink teddy bear   The pink teddy bear as seen during the second season A motif within the second season is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears at the end of the music video Fallacies for Jesse's band TwaghtHammr, which was released as a webisode in February 2009 leading to the second season.[60] The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence Seven Thirty-Seven down over ABQ.[61][62][63] The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film Schindler's List, in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat.[64] At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes;[65][66] the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the White family's pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones and the judgment of God.[67] In the first episode of the third season, the NTSB fishes the teddy bear out of his pool and Walt later finds the missing eye in the pool filter. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for,[68] and The A.V. Club commented that the pink teddy bear continues to accuse.[69]Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of Gus Fring's face in the fourth season finale.[70] The teddy bear was auctioned off, among other memorabilia, on September 29, 2013, the air date of the show finale.[71][72] On October 29 of the same year, Aaron Paul posted production pictures of Cranston posing with the teddy bear on Instagram.[73] Walt Whitman Walter White's name is reminiscent of the poet Walt Whitman.[62] The mid-season finale of season five, Gliding Over All, is titled after poem 271 of Whitman's Leaves of Grass.[74] During the series, Gale Boetticher gives Walt a copy of Leaves of Grass.[75] Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher, recites When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer.[76] In the episode Bullet ",
    "McKenzie and Clement were flatmates at Victoria University of Wellington, where they were studying film and theatre before forming Flight of the Conchords in 1998. They first performed as part of a five-man group called So You're a Man, which included Taika Waititi and debuted at Wellington's iconic BATS Theatre, garnering a small but loyal following in New Zealand and Australia.[3] Appearances[edit] The band performed its first televised performances over four nights (36 May 2000) on Newtown Salad, a show on Wellington's short-lived local TV station Channel 7 (later renamed WTV). The songs, in order, were Bowie, Ladies of the World, Petrov, Yelyena and Me, and Hotties.[4] They performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2002 and 2003, when they were nominated for the Perrier Award.[5] They also performed at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival where they won the Best Newcomer Award. They were later featured in a 2004 campaign for British mobile phone retailer Phones 4U.[6] They were also featured on Australia's ABC TV in the show Stand Up![7] HBO gave the group a special on their Friday night half-hour stand-up comedy series One Night Stand. They then headlined at the opening weekend at Comix comedy club where they recorded two tracks included on 2007's The Distant Future. They also performed at the South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas. During their visit to Texas, they recorded a documentary titled Flight of the Conchords: A Texan Odyssey, which aired on New Zealand's TV3 in late 2006.[8] In June 2007, the band performed on the Late Show with David Letterman[9] and were also interviewed by Terry Gross on the NPR radio show Fresh Air. The band appeared at the 2007 Bonnaroo Music Festivalin Manchester, Tennessee.[10] The EP The Distant Future was released. It was produced by Mickey Petralia and recorded in Los Angeles and New York by Petralia and engineer Matt Shane. The live portions were taken from concerts at Comix comedy club in New York City. On 19 June 2007, Flight of the Conchords appeared as the musical guests on Late Night with Conan O'Brien.[11] In January 2008, the band spoke and performed as part of Comcast's presentation at CES 2008.[12] On 10 February 2008, the band won the Grammy for best comedy album for The Distant Future.[13] On 13 February 2008, Flight of the Conchords had their first post-Grammy concert, a freebie show, at a small Wellington video store called Aro Video.[14] On 5 March 2008, Jemaine & Bret performed at a private show at 'The Depot' in Salt Lake City, Utah. The performance was for the 2008 Omniture web analytics conference. The following day, Flight of the Conchords performed in Cahn Auditorium at Northwestern University. On 24 April 2008, Jemaine and Bret played a free show at Amoeba Music in Hollywood, California. On 28 May 2008, Flight of the Conchords performed at the Google I/O conference inSan Francisco. The band performed on the Main Stage of the Sasquatch! Music Festival on Monday 26 May 2008 at The Gorge Amphitheatre in central Washington State. On 12 July 2008, Flight of the Conchords performed at Sub Pop's 20th Anniversary Music Festival. On 31 March 2009 the duo performed in Masterton New Zealand to 2000 locals as a benefit for Jemaine's old college Makoura Collegeraising around NZ$80,000 prior to setting off on a 50 date tour of the US. They also appeared on the season four finale of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! replacing Tim and Eric briefly during a high stakes game of tennis.   Flight of the Conchords performing at Cirkusin Stockholm, Sweden in May 2010. The duo guest starred as a pair of camp counselors in Elementary School Musical, the season premiere of the 22nd season of The Simpsons, which aired 26 September 2010.[15] On 23 August 2013, Flight of the Conchords co-headlined the Oddball & Curiosity Festival with Dave Chappelle, kicking off the tour in Austin, Texas. Kristen Schaal also performed on the tour, playing all dates except the final show 22 September 2013 in Phoenix, AZ.[16] BBC radio series[edit] Main article: Flight of the Conchords (radio series) In 2004, the band created a radio series for BBC Radio 2.[17] Largely improvised, the series was based on the band's search for commercial success in London. It featured Rob Brydon as their narrator,[17] Rhys Darby as their manager and Jimmy Carr as a devoted fan called Kipper. The radio series is clearly a progenitor of the television series: the plot is similar (the band arriving in a foreign country to make their fortune; Rhys Darby playing their manager and calling band meetings; and many of the songs were later used in the television series).[18] The BBC Radio 2 series won the duo the Bronze Sony Radio Academy Award for comedy.[19] HBO television series[edit] Main article: Flight of the Conchords (TV series) The duo starred in a television series for HBO, titled Flight of the Conchords, which premiered  "
